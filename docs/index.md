# Example Javascript charts

This example uses [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org) Javascript library to plot data from 
a CSV file stored on GitHub.

If you are a member of this repository, you can modify any of this **Markdown** text easily 
in your browser using GitHub's WYSIWYG editor.

Being on GitHub, of course you also have full version control which makes change auditing 
easy (e.g. see who's contributed each change), and you can quickly revert any change, 
if needed.
